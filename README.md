# Rain-Tyre-Performance
## Overview

The Rain Tyre Performance tool is a sophisticated simulation and analysis framework designed to evaluate the performance of rain tyres under varying wet conditions. By simulating parameters such as water displacement, grip levels, and wear rates, this tool provides insights into how rain tyres behave in dynamic track conditions.

## Features

- **Wet Surface Modelling**: Simulates varying wetness levels and their effects on tyre performance.
- **Water Displacement Analysis**: Evaluates the effectiveness of tread patterns in clearing water.
- **Grip and Wear Simulation**: Models grip and degradation over race distances.
- **Dynamic Track Conditions**: Adjusts performance based on changing water levels and temperatures.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generate comparative plots for performance metrics under wet conditions.
